House Price Prediction Using XGBoost Regressor üè°
This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts house prices for the California Housing dataset using the XGBoost Regressor. The model provides accurate predictions based on various features like location, population, number of rooms, and more.

Features
Implements the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm for regression tasks.
Uses the California Housing dataset for training and testing.
Provides exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset features and relationships.
Handles missing data, outliers, and feature engineering.
Includes evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and contains information about various houses in California, including:

Median house value
Median income
Average number of rooms
Average number of bedrooms
Population in the block
Latitude and Longitude
The dataset is sourced from Google Colab's libraries and is preprocessed for model training and evaluation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost
Install dependencies using pip:

```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost```
Running the Project
Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction```
```cd house-price-prediction```
Open the Colab notebook: House Price Prediction Colab Notebook

Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess it, and train the model.

Modify parameters in the notebook as needed for customizations.

Project Workflow
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and inspected for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights into the data.
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values
Feature scaling
Encoding categorical features
Model Training:
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Training the XGBoost Regressor model.
Evaluation:
Evaluating model performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
Plotting predicted vs actual prices.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model for better accuracy.
Results
The model achieves high accuracy with minimal error.
Evaluation metrics (example values):
MAE: 23,456
R-squared: 0.87
